<b>Girls meet out!</b>

Welcome to the funniest friends community! We started this community when covid and restriction limited us to live the life like before. We couldn't travel like before,
go to the gym, theater, cinema and so on.
We had to change our way to live. So we came up with the idea to create a group on Facebook, 
with some suggestions to meet covid-friendly
for old and new friends! There was great interest and we have tried to
hike in the mountains, horseback riding, cross-country skiing for example. 
Different activities we could do outside although covid.
When the restrictions lighted, we had the opportunities to go for a trip together. 
This has been a great opportunity to network with new friends and also 
support companies who had a hard time during covid.
Today we are 10 000 members och and our spots are filled fast when we arrange an event.

Welcome CamillaTH,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

Girs meet ut!
Welcome to the funniest friends community! We started this community when covid and restriction
limited us to live the life like before. We couldn't travel like before,
go to the gym, theater, cinema and so on.
We had to change our way to live. So we came up with the idea to create a group on Facebook, 
with some suggestions to meet covid-friendly
for old and new friends! There was great interest and we have tried to
hike in the mountains, horseback riding, cross-country skiing for example. 
Different activities we could do outside although covid.
When the restrictions lighted, we had the opportunities to go for a trip together. 
This has been a great opportunity to network with new friends and also 
support companies who had a hard time during covid.
Today we are 10 000 members och and our spots are filled fast when we arrange an event.
